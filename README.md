- Security guard checks his watch. **1 minute late.** He shakes his head solemnly, scribbles something on a notepad.
- *MC laughs it off.* Heads to class. *Everything seems normal… for now.*

---

### **The Verdict**

- *MC receives an email.* **Subject: "Severe Disciplinary Action – Do Not Attempt to Appeal."**
- Reads: *"Due to your violation (Lateness: 1 Minute), you are hereby prohibited from leaving campus for 12 years. Regards, Warden & Dean."*
- *MC laughs, thinking it’s a joke.* But then… 
- *Campus announcement echoes:* *"Attention all students: Unauthorized attempts to exit the campus will result in immediate consequences."*
- Looks around—no one else reacts. *Only he hears it.*
- **Paranoia begins.**

### **The Dean's Office: A Warning**

- *MC storms into the dean’s office.* 
- **Dean is abnormally still, staring out the window.** Room is eerily silent.
- **MC:** "Sir, about this email—"
- **Dean (slowly turning head, voice distorted):** "You should not have come here."
- *MC laughs awkwardly, about to leave—* but he left his phone on the desk.
- *Turns back. The room is now completely dark.*
- **Dean (now disfigured, eyes glowing):** *"I told you not to return."*
- *MC grabs his phone, looks up—Dean is gone.*
- **Behind him, a whisper:** *"I told you not to return."* 
- **BLACKOUT.**

### **Campus Paranoia Escalates**

- *Students whisper rules under their breath as he walks by:* *"Punctuality is discipline. Discipline is survival."*
- *Drops his pen, picks it up—everyone is staring at him, unblinking.*
- **MC (frustrated):** "Why are you all staring?!"
- **Student (deadpan):** "We’re not."
- *Looks away—when he looks back, they’re normal again.*
- **MC tries to escape campus, but the gates are gone. The entire perimeter is walled off.**
- **Campus is barely 500 meters wide, but now feels endless.**
- **Signs appear overnight:** *"Escape Attempts Reduce Your Cafeteria Privileges."*

### **Insomnia & Hallucinations Begin**

- *Warden appears in his room at night.* 
- **Warden (looming over him, face twisted):** "Breaking rules weakens the soul. Let me… help."

- *Next morning, he wakes up, sees scratch marks all over his arms. Did he do it?*
- *Sees students secretly sleeping in supply closets, in fear of being "corrected."*

- **Dean (smiling):** "You’ve come back. Good."
